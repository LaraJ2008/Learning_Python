#The problem of primes, I guess I would just go through the numbers in my head, checking each one for extraneous factors. I'd need to check 2/3/5/7 as factors to get to 100. \n
So what I'm doing is sort of a loop, and in my head once I find one factor that number doesn't even need to be checked against the rest. \nI guess I could ask for a list (2:100) and loop the numbers through division, looking for anything where x%factor = 0. If a 0 isn't found for any primes, that number gets written to a primes list? \nI'll have to think about how to handle 2/3/5/7 themselves...oh I guess I can set a clause of if x<9 do something else, tbd
\nSeems like checking each prime factor one after another for each number in 9:100 would work, and if # makes it though all the hoops, that lands it in [primes]
